# Skeletal Muscle Density in Ovarian-Cancer

## Description
Use machine learning to predict whether ovarian cancer patients have muscle attenuation, and use SHAP to explain the prediction results.

## Execution environment
This study was conducted using Python 3.9. The machine learning models were implemented using Scikit-learn version 1.4.1. The following model packages from the Scikit-learn library were used: CatBoostClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, SVC, and XGBClassifier. Feature contributions were calculated using SHAP version 0.44.1, and visualizations were generated using SHAP and matplotlib version 3.8.3.
